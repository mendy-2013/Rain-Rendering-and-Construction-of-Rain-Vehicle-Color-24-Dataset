Rain Vehicle Color 24 data set contains data of single target Vehicle,  multi-target Vehicle and target Vehicle in complex situations in real situations, etc., and the Vehicle data set has 24 Vehicle Color labels. However, this data set does not contain vehicle targets in rainy days.In order to enrich the data set, SyRaGAN is used in this paper to train the model. Each image can generate 5 rain maps with different directions, sizes and thicknesses. Rain Vehicle color-24 data set can obtain 40000 Vehicle rain maps. Combining with the rain data subset generated by PS technology, 40300 data sets of rain maps with a resolution of 512Ã—384 are finally obtained.
